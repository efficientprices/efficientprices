## Sampling - Filtering - Optimizing

This is the repository that stores the code for the sampling-filtering-optimizing framework introduced in the work "Revealing Efficient Financial Prices from
High-Frequency Market Information".

The python file "sampling_filtering_optimizing.py" keeps the python classes for applying the Kalman-filter and the non-linear optimization as well as a Plotting and Preprocessing class.
